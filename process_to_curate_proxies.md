# Creating a separate Python script to curate the proxies and export the curated list to a file:


1. Run the `curate_proxies.py` script to curate the proxies and save them to a file named `curated_proxies.txt`.

2. To read the curated list of proxies from the `curated_proxies.txt` file:

```python
# Inside youtube_watch.py
def get_curated_proxies_from_file():
    curated_proxies = []

    with open('curated_proxies.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            curated_proxies.append(line.strip())

    return curated_proxies

```

In this setup, the `curate_proxies.py` script is responsible for curating the proxies and exporting them to a file. Your main script reads the curated list of proxies from the file. Make sure to place both scripts in the same directory.

This separation allows you to curate the proxies separately whenever needed, and then your main script can utilize the curated list without the need to repeatedly curate proxies.
