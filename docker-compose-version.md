Sure! To create a Docker Compose file for building, running, and stopping the agent service in detached mode, you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as your Python script. This file will define the services and configurations for the agent.

2. Ensure you have the `Dockerfile` ready in the same directory as your Python script. This `Dockerfile` will be used to build the Docker image for your agent.

3. Before running the `docker-compose` commands, make sure you have the `requirements.txt` file in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`. This file should contain the required Python packages and their versions.

4. With everything set up, you can now use Docker Compose to build, run, and stop the agent service. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, and execute the following commands:

- Build and run the agent service in detached mode:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

- Stop the agent service:

```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

The agent service will be started in detached mode, and you can check the logs using:

```bash
sudo docker compose logs
```

With Docker Compose, you can easily manage and scale your agent service while keeping your agent code and dependencies isolated in a containerized environment.
